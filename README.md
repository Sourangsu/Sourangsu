My name is Sourangsu. I am currently working full-time at Momentum Optics, Inc. as a Lead Optical Engineer. In general, my interests lie at the intersection of computer science, electromagnetics, optics, photonics, and advanced manufacturing.

Nonetheless, I am also currently obsessed with Blockchain Technology and Cryptocurrency. Instead of crypto trading, I am interested to learn about its technical aspects and the technological advancements of the Blockchain. In the long run, I wish to get my hands dirty with coding some DApps. ðŸ˜„ ðŸ˜„ 

Since I love to do science, I support the idea behind the crytocurrency: Gridcoin. You can read all about Gridcoin [here](https://gridcoin.us/).
